### Assignment:

Use the TMDB API to create an app which shows the latest movies as a list with a poster image.

When an item on the list is clicked it should open a new screen that shows the movie image, description, year and rating.

There should be another activity in the app which shows the movies the user "liked" (saved movies).

Good luck.
